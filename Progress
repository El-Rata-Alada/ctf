1. intro - decoded
2. level 1 - seems to be plus codes in the file. took the degrees seriously.(free hint) -> converted the plus codes into latitudes and longitudes degrees. -> removed the dots -> ascii conversion -> rearrangements -> decoded. got NEBULAARK
3. level 3 - 
string a:
  As the hint says the flag is in index.html. When we inspected the page there is a section of script we came across a path /legal/iota/epsilon/eta/data.html
when we got into there at the corner of the page we got string a : a9B#4pD!
string b:
from the hint the second file found from robot.txt.we hosted the whole folder in vas code using live server and we searched in disallowed paths. 
this path blog/gamma/zeta/delta/iota/zeta/ has a html file name nika.html which kas given us the string b : z6@Wv7L$2q
